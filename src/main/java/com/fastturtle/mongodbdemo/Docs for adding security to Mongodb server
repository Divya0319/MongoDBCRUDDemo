1. Open Mongodb server instance from ssh
2. Open its mongod.conf file located in etc/mongod.conf
3. Enable security by adding line
    security:
      authorization: enabled

4. Switch to the admin database:

   use admin
5. Authenticate as an admin user: If you already have an admin user:


   db.auth("admin_username", "admin_password")

6. If you don’t have an admin user(or forgot its password),
   you’ll need to start MongoDB without authentication and create one:

   Stop the MongoDB service.
   Restart MongoDB without the authorization: enabled setting in mongod.conf.

   Create an admin user:

   db.createUser({
     user: "admin_username",
     pwd: "admin_password",
     roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]
   })

   then do step 5 if not done

7. Grant roles to scalerstudent:   grant readWrite access to scalerstudent on the ecommerceapp database:
    db.grantRolesToUser("scalerstudent", [{ role: "readWrite", db: "ecommerceapp" }])

    7.1 -> If you want to add more databases to same user, you can simply use above command with new database name(note that it will not error out even if database not exists).

8. Re-enable authorization in mongod.conf

9. Restart mongodb server

10. Now, you can safely use scalerstudent user to connect to MongoDB's ecommerceapp database.

11. After assigning the appropriate roles, reconnect using MongoDB Compass:

    Authentication Database: admin
    Ensure you’re using the scalerstudent credentials.
    You should now see the ecommerceapp database listed.
